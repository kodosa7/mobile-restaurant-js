## Mobile Restaurant Site
A Scrimba exercise solo project. The goal was to create a mini site for a fiction restaurant with ability of ordering pizza, hamborgers and beer. All the healthy stuff you need.

# Requirements
- Follow the design spec (https://www.figma.com/file/Hdgwo69Dym9vVsxbuPbl0h/Mobile-Restaurant-Menu?node-id=0%3A1)
- Render the menu options using JavaScript
- Be able to add/remove items
- Have a payment modal with compulsory from inputs

# Hints
- You can use an array method to iterate over the data and create HTML string for each menu item.
- You can use a data-attribute to link a button to a menu item.
- When an item is added to an order, you will need to push its object to an array of orders and iterate over that array to generate html string.
- To remove an order, you will need to figure out the index of that menu itemâ€™s object in the array of orders.
